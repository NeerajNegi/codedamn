## Hall of Fame üèÜ

At codedamn, we take security of the product very seriously. If you find any security vulnerability, we would be happy to list your details on the Hall of Fame section of codedamn. As of now, we do not offer monetary rewards or swags for security vulnerabilities, but that should change soon.

In any circumstances, DO NOT perform any action which might lead to any other users' data compromise, data leak while pentesting the platform. Social engineering attacks are out of scope.
